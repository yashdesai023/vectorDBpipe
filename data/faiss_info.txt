FAISS Vector Store
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
VectorDBPipe uses faiss-cpu for extremely fast local vector search.
Unlike ChromaDB, FAISS is primarily an in-memory index, but we have implemented a local persistence layer using pickle to save the index to disk.
Choose FAISS if you need maximum speed for local workloads.
