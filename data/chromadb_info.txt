ChromaDB Integration
ChromaDB is a popular open-source vector database used for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.
In VectorDBPipe, ChromaDB is supported as a local persistent storage backend.
It is ideal for development and testing because it does not require an API key or cloud setup.
You can configure ChromaDB in the simple config.yaml file under the 'vector_db' section.
